Bitcoin is increasingly establishing itself as a digital investment asset other than a mere speculative instrument. In this work, we explore this subject by studying the correlation that Bitcoin has with other standard assets such as stock and bond indexes,  currencies and commodities. We first study the empirical correlation and its statistical significance, then calibrate more sophisticated asset models including jump diffusion and stochastic volatility in their multivariate generalizations to obtain the correlation matrices also under those frameworks. Results are closely related and Bitcoin correlation  with any other asset is confirmed to be very low. Given this result, we perform optimal portfolio allocation analyses to investigate its diversification properties, both through Markowitz mean-variance optimization and using the CVaR as the portfolio risk measure. Evidence shows that allocating a small percentage of wealth in the digital assets proves to be extremely beneficial in terms of lowering the risk and increasing the expected returns.
