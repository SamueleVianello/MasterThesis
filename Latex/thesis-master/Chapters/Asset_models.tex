\chapter{Presentation of the Models}
\label{chpr:models}
In this chapter we will present the stochastic frameworks in which we developed our analysis. We first introduce a \textit{jump diffusion} model presented in 1976 by R.C. Merton: he added log-normal jumps to the simple B\&S dynamics of the asset price. Then we move to the \textit{stochastic volatility} model of Heston 1993. Heston introduced a new stochastic process that accounts for the variance of the underlying which evolves as a B\&S  with a stochastic volatility term.
The last model we will present was introduced by Bates in 1996 and it is the combination of the former two: an asset dynamics which include jumps and is driven by a stochastic volatility.
All models are first introduced in the one dimensional case and then generalised to the $n$ dimensional case which was then implemented in our code.

\section{Preliminary Notions}

In this section we will briefly present the equation of a geometric brownian motion, introduce the notion of Poisson process and present the 
CIR process. All of these building blocks will be required to fully understand the models to follow.


\subsection{Geometric Brownian Motion}
The simplest continuous dynamics to describe the price of an asset is that of a geometric brownian motion:
\begin{equation}
	\label{GBM_eq}
	\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \mu dt + \sigma dW_t
\end{equation}

where $S_t$ represents the price of the asset at time $t$, $\mu$ is the (constant) drift and $\sigma$ is the (constant) volatility. $W_t$ is a Wiener process.
This is the standard and most widespread stichastic differential equation to model asset dynamics, so we will only present those results that will be later used in our study.


Applying Ito's lemma to the previous equation, we can also explicitly express the dynamics of the log-returns $X_t = log(S_t)$ , obtaining:
\begin{equation}
	dX_t = (\mu - 	\frac{\sigma^2}{2}) dt + \sigma dW_t
\end{equation}

This stochastic differential has a simple solution which can be computed via stochastic integrals and allows us to describe the dynamics of the log-returns at each instant $t$ starting from $t=0$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{GBM_ret_sol}
	X_t = X_0 + (\mu - 	\frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t + \sigma W_t
\end{equation}

Thanks to (\ref{GBM_ret_sol}) we can now express the price dynamics of the asset by inverting the relation with the returns: $S_t = e^{X_t}$. 
We thus obtain the solution to (\ref{GBM_eq}):
\begin{equation}
	S_t = S_0 \;e^{(\mu - 	\frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t + \sigma W_t}
\end{equation}

Given that $S_t = e^{X_t}$, that $X_t$ by its equation is a generalized brownian motion and hence we have $X_t - X_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu - 	\frac{\sigma^2}{2}, \sigma^2)$, the resulting distribution of prices at time $t$ as units of the initial value is distibuted as a log-normal.

The great success of these framework comes from the simplicity of its dynamics. In particular, since the log-returns follow a Gaussian distribution, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are easy to calibrate from data and the formulas for pricing options  are often explicit.
As one can imagine, a simple model can only explain simple phenomena: that's why we have such a great deal of \textit{new and improved} version of equation \ref{GBM_eq}.

\subsection{Poisson Process and Compound Poisson Process}
Consider a sequence of \textit{independent} exponential random variables  $\{\tau_i\}_{i\geq1}$ with parameter $\lambda$\footnote{An exponential random variable $\tau$ of parameter $\lambda$ has a cumulative distibution function of the form: $\mathbb{P}(\tau \geq y) = e^{-\lambda y}$} and let $T_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\tau_i$. Then we can define the \textit{Poisson process} $N_t$ as
\begin{equation}
 	N_t = \sum_{n\geq 1} \mathds{1}_{t \geq T_n}
\end{equation}

where $\mathds{1}_{condition}$ is 1 if the \textit{condition} is true, 0 if it is false.

$N_t$ is thus a piece-wise constant RCLL\footnote{RCLL is shorthand for right continuous with left limit.} process with jumps that happen at times $T_n$ and are all of size 1, as we can see from Figure \cref{fig:pois}.
An important property of Posson processes is that they have independent and stationary increments, meaning that the increment of $N_t - N_s$ (with $s\leq t$) is independent from the history of the process up to $N_s$ and has the same law of $N_{t-s}$.
At any time $t$, $N_t$ is distributed as a Poisson of parameter $\lambda t$, which means it is a discrete random variable on the integer set with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pois_pdf}
\mathbb{P}( N_t = n) = e^{-\lambda t}\frac{(\lambda t)^n}{n!}
\end{equation}

	\label{fig:pois_process}
\end{figure}

When working with jump diffusion process, it is often the case that there is no explicit formula for its density, thus usually we resort to characteristic functions. The characteristic function of $N_t$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pois_chf}
	\phi_{N_t}(u)=e^{\lambda t (e^{iu}-1)}
\end{equation}

The computations to get \ref{eq:pois_chf} from \ref{eq:pois_pdf} are carried out in Appendix \ref{app:A}. 

\bigskip
For financial applications, it is of little interest to have a process with a single possible jump size. The \textit{compound} Poisson processes are a generalization of Poisson processes  where  the jump sizes can have an arbitrary distribution. More precisely, consider a Poisson process $N_t$ with parameter $\lambda$ and a sequence of i.i.d\footnote{i.i.d stands for independent and identically distributed.} variables ${Y_i}_{i\geq 1}$ with law $f_Y(y)$. Then the process defined by
\begin{equation}
	X_t = \sum_{n=1}^{N_t} Y_i
\end{equation}
is a compound Poisson process. Examples of this kind of process are plotted in Figure \cref{fig:compound_pois}.

As before, we developed the computations to obtain an expression for the characteristic function of $X_t$ in Appendix \ref{app:A}. The resulting expression depends on the distribution of $Y$, specifically from its characteristic function:

\begin{equation}
	\phi_{X_t}(u) = e^{\lambda t (\phi_Y(u)-1)}
\end{equation}

\section{Merton Model}

 ******maybe add some words right here ********
%%% ORIGINAL MODEL
\subsection{Original Univariate Model}
The first jump diffusion model was originally introduced in \cite{MERTON1976} in order to account for the leptokurtic distribution of real market returns and to model sudden fall (or rise) in prices due to the arrival of new information.
The asset price dynamics is modelled as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{merton_model}
\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \alpha dt + \sigma dW_t  + (Y_t-1)dN
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ are respectively the drift and the diffusion of the continuous part, $Y_t$ is a process modelling the intensity of the jumps and $N(t)$ is the Poisson process driving the arrival of the jumps and has parameter $\lambda$.

We can rewrite (\ref{merton_model}) in terms of the log-returns $X_t = log(S_t)$ and obtain, following the computations in \cite{MARTIN2007} and using theory from \cite{TANKOV2015}:
\begin{equation}
dX_t = (\alpha - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})dt + \sigma dW_t + \log (Y_t)
\end{equation}

that has as solution:
\begin{equation}
\label{merton_returns}
X_t =X_0 +  \mu t + \sigma W_t + \sum_{k=1}^{N(t)} \eta_k
\end{equation}

where $X_0$ is the initial value of the log-returns, $\eta_k= \log(Y_k) = \log(Y_{t_k})$ and $t_k$ is the time when the $k^{th}$ Poisson shock from $N(t)$ happens. We use $\mu = \alpha - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} $ for ease of notation throughout the paper.
Following \cite{MERTON1976}, we take $\eta_k$ \textit{i.i.d.} (independent and identically distributed) and Gaussian, in particular $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta, \delta^2)$.
Another choice for the distribution of $\eta$ is given in \cite{KOU2002}. 

%% AGGIUNGERE DENSITA' NEL caso generale [0,T] ?

It is often useful when dealing with market data that are by nature discrete, to consider a \textit{discretized} version of (\ref{merton_returns}) in which the values are sampled at intervals of $\Delta t$ in $[0, T]$. We thus get that for $X_i = \log(\frac{S_{i+1}}{S_i})$:

\begin{equation}
\label{discrete_returns}
X_i =  \mu \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \; z +  \sum_{k=1}^{N_{i+1} - N_i} Y_k
\end{equation}

where we denote $X_i = X_{t_i}$, $N_i = N(t_i)$ and $t_i = i \Delta t$ with $i= 0 \dots N$, $t_N = N \Delta t= T$,  $z$ is distributed as a standard Gaussian $ z\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$.

The Poisson process $N(t)$ in (\ref{discrete_returns}) is computed at times $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$ and these quantities are subtracted. Following basic stochastic analysis, one can prove that the resulting value $N_{i+1} - N_i$,  is distributed as a Poisson random variable $N$ of parameter $\lambda \Delta t$.
This allows us to provide an explicit formulation for the transition density of the returns using the theorem of total probability:

\begin{equation}
\label{transitional}
f_{\Delta X} (x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(N = k) f_{\Delta X | N = k}(x) 
\end{equation}

This is an infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions, due to the infinite possible realization of the Poisson variable, and renders the estimation of the model through MLE technique intractable, see \cite{HONORE1998}.
To solve this problem we introduce a first order approximation, as it's been proposed in \cite{BALLTOROUS1983}. Considering small $\Delta t$, so that also $\lambda \Delta t $ is small, we obtain that the only relevant terms in (\ref{transitional}) are the one for $ k = 0, 1$.
The formula for the transition density becomes:
\begin{equation*}
f_{\Delta X} (x) = \mathbb{P}(N = 0) f_{\Delta X | N = 0}(x) + \mathbb{P}(N = 1) f_{\Delta X | N = 1}(x)
\end{equation*}
expressing it explicitly:
\begin{equation}
f_{\Delta X} (x) = (1 - \lambda \Delta t) \;f_{\mathcal{N}}(x ; \mu, \sigma^2) + (\lambda \Delta t)\; f_{\mathcal{N}}(x ; \mu + \theta, \sigma^2+\delta^2)
\end{equation}
where $f_{\mathcal{N}}(x ; \mu, \sigma^2)$ is the density of a Gaussian with parameters $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$.


%%% MULTIVARIATE MODEL
\subsection{Multivariate Model}
Starting from the univariate model introduced in \cite{MERTON1976}, we developed a generalization to $n$ assets including only idiosyncratic jumps:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_t^{(j)}}{S_t^{(j)}} = \alpha_j dt + \sigma_j dW_t^{(j)} + (Y^{(j)}_t -1) dN^{(j)}_t
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{S}_t$ are the prices of the assets, $j = 1 ... n$ represents the asset, $\alpha_j$ are the drifts, $\sigma_j$ are the diffusion coefficients, $W^{(j)}_t$ are the components of an $n$-dimensional Wiener process $ \mathbf{W}_t$ with $dW^{(j)}dW^{(i)}=\rho_{j,i}$, $\eta_j$ represent the intensities of the jumps and are distributed as Gaussian: $\eta_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta_j , \delta_j^2)$. Finally, $N^{(j)}(t)$ are Poisson processes with parameters $\lambda_j$, which are independent of $\mathbf{W}_t$ and of one another. 

In order to calibrate the parameters to the value of the market log-returns, we used a Maximum Likelihood approach. We thus maximize:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\psi | \Delta \mathbf{x}_{t_1},\Delta \mathbf{x}_{t_2},\dots,\Delta \mathbf{x}_{t_N}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_{\Delta \mathbf{X}}(\Delta\mathbf{x}_{t_i} | \psi)
\end{equation}

where $\psi = \{ \{\mu_j\},\{\sigma_j\},\{\rho_{i,j}\},\{\theta_j\},\{\delta\}_j,\{\lambda_j\} \}$ are the model parameters, $f_{\Delta \mathbf{X}}$ is the transitional density of the log-returns which is computed approximately using the theorem of total probability.
